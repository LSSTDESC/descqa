#Coefficients provided by Joe DeRose
#    Obtained fron fitting DES data 
#    with convenient polynomial approximations.
#    For an example showing how the polynomial fitting was done:
#    c3_ri, c2_ri, c1_ri, c0_ri = np.polyfit(z_table, mean_colors['ri'], 3)
#    where z_table, mean_colors are taken from DES fits data files
#      p0   p1   p2 p3
