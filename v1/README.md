# DESCQA v1

This direcory hosts the catalog readers and validation tests of DESCQA **v1**,
as presented in the [companion paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09665)).

These catalog readers and validation tests should be considered frozen.

To make DESCQA v1 compatibile with the updated master execution script,
the validation tests are stored under [descqa](descqa)
and catalog readers are stored under [GCRCatalogs](GCRCatalogs)
(although these readers do NOT use the GCR interface).

## Looking for up-to-date version?

- [Click here](../descqa) for v2 tests.
- [Click here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/gcr-catalogs) for v2 catalogs (GCRCatalogs).
